Hi, I’m Thomas Roberts — a Computer Science graduate and software engineer focused on full-stack development and AI integration. I’ve built tools using Angular, .NET Core, Node.js, and GPT-4o to automate healthcare workflows like CPT/HCPCS code extraction and document analysis.

My interests include:
- AI/LLM-powered applications
- OCR pipelines and GPT automation
- Scalable backend systems (Node.js, .NET)
- Mobile development (React Native, FastAPI)

 Projects:
- CPT Coding Assistant (Azure OCR + GPT-4o)
- AI Benchmarking Dashboard (Angular + .NET Core)
- iOS Book Selector App (React Native + Supabase)
